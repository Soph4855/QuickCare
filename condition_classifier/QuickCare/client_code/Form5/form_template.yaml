        Set clear goals: Determine what you want to achieve with your workouts. Whether
        it’s weight loss, muscle gain or endurance, having clear, actionable goals
        can help you remain focused and motivated in the long run.


        Listen to your body: Pay attention to how your body is feeling during and
        after exercise. Pushing yourself is very useful, but not to the point of pain
        and exhaustion.


        Incorporate strength, cardio, and flexibility exercises: Strength exercises
        are extremely useful in terms of building muscle mass and endurance. Cardio,
        as the name suggests, will greatly improve heart health and assist in burning
        calories. Finally, flexibility exercises not only reduce muscle tension, but
        also enhance your overall range of motion.


        Prioritize form: Prioritizing form is essential in preventing strain, injuries
        and getting the most out of exercise. If unsure at the proffer technique,
        seek advice from a fitness professional.


        Stay Hydrated: Drinking plenty of water before, throughout and after your
        workouts is essential to remain hydrated and perform at your best.


        Rest and Recovery: Don’t push your body to the extent of pain or injury. It
        is important to rest in between workouts to ensure an energized performance
        for the next session.


        Make it enjoyable: Staying fit doesn’t have to be a mundane task -- try working
        out with friends, joining group fitness classes, and listening to podcasts
        or music while exercising.', font_size: null, font: '', spacing_above: small,
