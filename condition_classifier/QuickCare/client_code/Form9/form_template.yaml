        Stick to a sleep schedule: Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every
        day, even on weekends. Consistency helps regulate your body''s internal clock.


        Limit exposure to screens before bedtime: The blue light emitted by phones,
        tablets, and computers can interfere with your sleep. Avoid screens for at
        least an hour before going to bed.


        Create a comfortable sleep environment: Make sure your bedroom is quiet, dark,
        and at a comfortable temperature. Invest in a comfortable mattress and pillows.


        Limit daytime naps: If you need to nap during the day, keep it short (around
        20-30 minutes) and avoid napping too close to bedtime.


        Be mindful of alcohol consumption: While alcohol may initially make you feel
        drowsy, it can disrupt your sleep later in the night and lead to fragmented
        sleep.


        Avoid large meals before bedtime: Eating a heavy meal close to bedtime can
        lead to discomfort and indigestion, making it harder to sleep.


        Consult a healthcare professional if you have persistent sleep issues: If
        you constantly struggle with falling asleep, staying asleep, or other sleep-related
        concerns, seek guidance from a healthcare professional or a sleep specialist.',
