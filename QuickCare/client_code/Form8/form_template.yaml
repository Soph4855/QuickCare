        \ exercises and meditation to stay present and reduce anxiety. This can help\
        \ you develop a more complete awareness of your thoughts and learn to recognize\
        \ triggers of certain feelings you may be facing. \n\nRemain active: Regular\
        \ exercise has numerous mental health benefits, including reducing stress\
        \ and boosting mood. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderately intense exercise\
        \ or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week.\n\nSet boundaries: Remember\
        \ to say no when you feel overwhelmed and establish healthy boundaries with\
        \ work, social commitments, and other responsibilities.\n\nEngage in hobbies\
        \ and interests: Make time for activities you enjoy and that bring you a sense\
        \ of fulfillment and relaxation.\n\nSeek professional help: If you're feeling\
        \ overwhelmed or struggling with your mental health, don't hesitate to reach\
        \ out to a mental health professional or counselor. More and more people are\
        \ turning to counseling as a way to manage their mental health, and witnessing\
        \ extraordinary benefits as a result. \n\nExpress your feelings: Talk to someone\
        \ you trust about your emotions or consider keeping a journal to express and\
        \ process your feelings.\n\nPractice gratitude: Try to remain focused on the\
        \ positive aspects of your life. Keeping a gratitude journal can help you\
        \ recognize the things that make you happy, allowing you to make them a more\
        \ frequent part of your life.", font_size: null, font: '', spacing_above: small,
